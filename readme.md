# Microsoft Rewards Farmer
An application written in Java to farm the daily [Microsoft Rewards](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/rewards).

## Overview
It uses the [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) framework for automation interaction with the browser. This 
program will automatically complete search requests on [Microsoft Rewards](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/rewards).
The used search terms are selected randomly from a text file filled with 370,099 words. The bot usually takes a minute
to complete the search at Bing. This project is 100% free to use and open source. Feel free to contribute or give me
feedback.

This project was inspired by [Microsoft-Rewards-Bot](https://github.com/xMNG/Microsoft-Rewards-Bot) from 
[xMNG](https://github.com/xMNG), which was written in Python. So that the search queries also build on existing word
categories, I use the [wordlists](https://github.com/imsky/wordlists) from [imsky](https://github.com/imsky).
